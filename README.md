# Guess My Number Game

## About ðŸ”¬
- This is a really small project created to practice Javascript and DOM manipulation.

- The project is part of the Jonas Schmedtmann's The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert! course, I added a few additional feautures such as responsive view, accessibility and additional UI change when you lose the game.

## Game Rules ðŸš€

1- The game is played between one player and the computer.

2- The computer chooses a number between 1 and 20, and keeps it secret from the player.

3- The player tries to guess the number that the computer has chosen.

4- The player will be given a 20 guesses to make, and if they do not guess the number correctly within that limit, the game is over.

5- The winner is the player who correctly guesses the number in the fewest number of guesses. If the player does not correctly guess the number within the allotted number of guesses, the computer is declared the winner.
